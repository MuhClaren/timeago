NOTES: Any translations which require non-English word order of the TimeAgo output string, the translator should notify me of such requirements when submitting the translation.

OPTIONAL: Native phpBB date-time output can be customized: ACP --> General --> Board Settings --> Date Format: custom. Edit the string to your required specifications. You'll need to push this custom setting to the users, too, since it's not set to custom by default at installation. Please note that this is optional, and not required for TimeAgo to function.
